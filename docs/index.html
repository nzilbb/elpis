    <h1>nzilbb.elpis Documentation</h1>

    <p>This is client library for communicating with
      <a href="https://elpis.net.au/">Elpis</a>
      web application servers.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Elpis?</h2>

    <p>Elpis is a tool to obtain a first-pass automatic transcription on untranscribed
      audio, for manual correction.</p>

    <p>Elpis was developed by the
      <a href="https://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/">
        Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language (CoEDL)</a>
      as part of the <em>Transcription Acceleration Project</em> (TAP) cross-disciplinary
      project aimed at identifying the workflows of linguists and language workers during
      transcription, and developing assistive tools to accelerate that process. </p> 

    <p>It has a user-friendly browser-based interface, which can be used by researchers
      to upload training data, initiate model training, and provide recordings for
      automatic transcription.</p>

    <p>This GUI uses an API which is documented
      <a href="https://github.com/nzilbb/elpis-java/blob/master/docs/README.md">here</a>.</p>
        
    <h2>What is this library?</h2>
    
    <p>The library provides programmatic access to Elpis API for Java, developed by the
      <a href="https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/nzilbb/">
        New Zealand Institute of Language, Brain and Behaviour</a> (NZILBB).</p>
    
    <p>Detailed JavaDoc object model documentation is available
