/**
 * Elpis client library.
 * <p>This is client library for communicating with 
 *  <a href="https://elpis.net.au/">Elpis</a>
 *  web application servers.</p>
 *
 * <h2>What is Elpis?</h2>
 *
 * <p>Elpis is a tool to obtain a first-pass automatic transcription on untranscribed
 *   audio, for manual correction.</p>
 * <p>Elpis was developed by the
 *  <a href="https://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/">
 *   Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language (CoEDL)</a>
 *  as part of the <em>Transcription Acceleration Project</em> (TAP) cross-disciplinary
 *  project aimed at identifying the workflows of linguists and language workers during
 *  transcription, and developing assistive tools to accelerate that process. </p> 
 * <p>It has a user-friendly browser-based interface, which can be used by researchers
 *   to upload training data, initiate model training, and provide recordings for
 *   automatic transcription.</p>
 * <p>This GUI uses an API which is documented
 *  <a href="https://github.com/nzilbb/elpis-java/blob/master/docs/README.md">here</a>.</p>
 *     
 * <h2>What is this package?</h2>
 *    
 * <p>This package provides programmatic access to Elpis API for Java.</p>
